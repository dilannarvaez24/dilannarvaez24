### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Hey, my name is Dilan and sometimes I would like to be called Tom. The reason basically is because this is my name in my job. Usually, I thoigh that maybe is my unreal doppleganger or maybe my "second self". Additionally, IÂ´m colorblind and enjoy working with something where colors are involved. Time ago I was studying for becoming a chemistry teacher but I let it go; now IÂ´m studying for becoming an electrical engineering ðŸ¥µ and this is something I really enjoy, regardless colors will be a seriuos problem in the future. But meh, nothing that I cannot fix by the moment.
